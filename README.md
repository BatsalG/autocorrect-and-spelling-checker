# Autocorrect andd Spelling Checker
This Python program identifies when a word is misspelled and provides the closest suggesttion. Not only that, based on the style of literature, the word occurence and content can be changed. So, when writing a Shakespearean play, the word recommendations will reflect that.

Using Counting Bloom Filter (CBFs), Damerau_Levenshtein Distance, and dynamic programming, this program provides recommendations for misspelled words.
